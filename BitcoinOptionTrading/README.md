Published in: Trading Strategies for Bitcoin Options based on Deviations in Risk Neutral and Historical Densities

Description: Deviations in Risk Neutral Density (RND) and Historical Density (HD) can be used to develop trading strategies. The Risk Neutral Density is estimated via Rookleyâ€™s Method, which uses Local Polynomial Regression to smooth the implied volatility surface. In order to estimate the Historical Density, a GARCH(1,1) model is used to fit the bahavior of the underlying. In the scope of this thesis two python packages were developed and deployed on pypi.org - localpoly and spd_trading.
